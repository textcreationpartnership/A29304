         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Some ADDITION to a former PAPER, Entituled, A Short Declaration of the Purpo≈øe and Decree of the Everla≈øting Coun≈øel of God's Heavenly Ho≈øt,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OH thou Off-≈øpring of God! Who can ≈øet forth the glory of thy Conception, Birth, and Being, and the Womb that bears thee, and brings thee forth, and the Brea≈øt that gives thee ≈øuck, and tho≈øe Paps from whence thy nouri≈øhment comes? Thou noble Seed, and Plant, and Babe of everla≈øting bli≈øs; my ≈øoul delights in the glorious beauty of thy exceeding comline≈øs, in every part of thy Body; which art joyned to ≈øo glorious a Head, which gives thee thy Being in him≈øelf, who is over all Principalities and Powers; the Triumph over Death, Hell, and the Graves ≈øitting on the Throne of exceeding Dominion and Authority over all.</p>
            <p>The almighty Power, which is the beginning of the Creation of God, is the fir≈øt of thy Conception; the Father of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, from the bo≈øom of his eternal Love and Coun≈øel doth this Seed i≈ø≈øue forth; which is of perfect purity and clearne≈øs, and uniteth not with any thing of that which defileth: For, that which defileth, ri≈øeth out of that part which ≈øtandeth in the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion, and in that Nature and Being, which is not of God, but of the Devil, the Father of lyes, and all fal≈øe conceptions, which ≈øtand in the time of the fall from God, the ≈øeed of the Serpent, which was brought forth ≈øince the Creation, in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. But thou, noble Seed of the everla≈øting God, who wert before Creation was, or had a being in this Earth; who≈øe goings forth have been manife≈øted in time, though thou had≈øt thy Being in God before all time; who wert, and art the Fathers delight, becau≈øe it was from his own loynes, and bo≈øom of his eternal Love.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54319:3"/>
            <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How doth God manife≈øt this noble Seed in Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> God who is Light, doth ≈øhine forth by his Son, who is the Light of him≈øelf, in the hearts &amp; con≈øciences of men, which are in darkne≈øs, and covered with the ≈øhadow of death; which death came upon all men for the di≈øobedience ≈øake; &amp; the Light is manife≈øted, to ≈øhew unto men, that they are ≈øo in death and darkne≈øs, and ≈øeparated from God, who is Light; that they lie under his wrath, and are in angui≈øh, wo, and mi≈øery, without any hope of recovery, as from them≈øelves, or any power under Heaven. And therefore this Light is God's Witne≈øs, ≈øet in Man, to reprove, judge, and condemn, ≈ømite, and check that which di≈øobeys and ≈øins again≈øt it; and brings the ≈øorrow and angui≈øh upon the ≈øinner, as a reward for his iniquity.</p>
            <p>And herein is the free Love of God manife≈øted unto the world, that <hi>he hath ≈øent his onely begotten Son into the World;</hi> who is the Light of the world, <hi>that who≈øoever believeth in him,</hi> who is Light in them, <hi>≈øhould not peri≈øh,</hi> nor abide in darkne≈øs, but ≈øhall have the Light of Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore the way to know this noble Seed, and how God doth manife≈øt it in man, is to know, and believe in the Light, that ≈øhines in the dark hearts of the ≈øons of men; and as thou come≈øt to hearken to its reproof, and believe in that which ≈øhews thee the ≈øecrets of thy deceitful heart: It will manife≈øt its ≈øelf in its power, to di≈øcover unto thee, that thou art not ruled by it, but by the power of the Devil, and the lu≈øtful deceits of thy own corrupt heart, while thou ≈øtande≈øt in the unbelief and di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Light; and by the power of the Light of the Son of God, thou wilt ≈øee and be ≈øen≈øible of the ≈øtrength &amp; power of ≈øin and corruption; and as the Light doth ari≈øe in thee, thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, wilt ≈øee unbelief, and ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinful; and ≈øin appearing in its nature and kind. And this is the fir≈øt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Light, after the mind is turned to it, and convinced by it, to let thee ≈øee thy ≈øtate and condition; that thou art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God and Chri≈øt in the world; which nothing can di≈øcover but the Light, nor make thee ≈øen≈øible of, but the power of the ≈øame; which is the mea≈øure of this noble Seed, which God hath ≈øown: And Light is ≈øown to the Righteous; and this will bring thee, thou following it, (which convinceth of ≈øin and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54319:3"/>to receive and love the Light; and ≈øo in his Light to ≈øee Light, and to bring all thy deeds to the Light, and to hate thy evil deeds, and to love the Light that doth make them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt; and ≈øo thy heart being made manife≈øt unto thee, and thy ≈øins ≈øet as in order before thee, and the Light ri≈øing up in thee in its power, judgement, and condemnation, then thou wilt come to abhor thy ≈øelf for all thy abominations; and this will make thee cry out, <hi>What ≈øhall I do to be ≈øaved?</hi> And to ≈øay, <hi>O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerable man that I am who ≈øhall deliver me from this body of ≈øin and death?</hi> And there will be a hope begotten in thee, to make thee, in thy ≈øelf, to wait to know the <hi>Saviour and Redeemer, that comes out of Sion, and turns away ungodline≈øs from Jacob.</hi> And ≈øo thou waiting in the Light, which doth work ≈øuch an effect as is before mentioned; then thou wilt feel ≈øtriving in thee, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>E≈øau,</hi> the elder and the younger; but the elder is to ≈øerve the younger, <hi>Jacob</hi> the pure plant, and Seed of the Promi≈øe, the everla≈øting Covenant of God, the Seed of the Woman, which is to break the Serpents head. And the ruffe ≈øeed <hi>E≈øau,</hi> the ≈øeed of the Serpent, the ≈øeed of God's Cur≈øe; the≈øe will war one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt another; but the ≈øeed of the Covenant, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, is pure, clean, and ju≈øt, ≈øingle, and upright, and wars in righteou≈øne≈øs; for it is of the righteous God, and therefore wars again≈øt the ≈øubtile ≈øeed of the Serpent; the cunning hunter, ≈øhi≈øter, deceitful, unclean, profane, wild, airy, fla≈øhy, empty, and is void of the knowledge of God; which the pure noble Seed of the Woman, the ≈øeed of the Covenant of Life, cannot have unity with, nor own any of its wayes, or wild workings; but di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him, in all his ≈øtrong holds of ≈øin and iniquity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells again≈øt the righteous Law of God, who is the onely Lord and Law-giver: And that is the cau≈øe of the righteous war of the Lord God in man; to bring the≈øe ≈øtrong holds of ≈øin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity under his righteous Seed; and that, that will not that he ≈øhall raign, mu≈øt be ≈ølain before him, by his righteous ≈øword with two edges: And ble≈ø≈øed of the Lord God for ever, are all ≈øuch that are entred into this war, and that ≈øtand faithful in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; warring with the armour of God; which are the ≈øeveral branches or weapons of the ≈øeed of Light and Life, which are mighty through God, to the ca≈øting down of ≈øtrong holds, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54319:4"/>bringeth every thought into obedience to the Light; and this is through believing, which purifies the heart; and that is the Faith, which if it be but as a grain of mu≈øtard ≈øeed, victory over mountains of ≈øin will be witne≈ø≈øed, and a hope will be begotten, and patience, and experience of the working of its power; and this will be as the Anchor of the ≈øoul, ≈øure and ≈øtedfa≈øt, again≈øt all the ≈øtorms and tempe≈øts, that may ari≈øe to drive the ≈øoul to ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack from its God, which is its only ≈øtrength: and ≈øo the glory of the Seed of everla≈øting bli≈øs comes to be known, to increa≈øe in its battels, and wars, again≈øt all the fruits of the evil and cur≈øed ≈øeed of the Serpent; and Chri≈øt's En≈øign comes to be lift up, and his Standard comes to be gathered unto, and his vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant di≈øplaying of his Banner is known with triumph, in the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ≈øo glorious a Captaine of Salvation, which ≈øaves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems out of that vile ≈øervitude, by which they were kept in by the Devils power, which carried them captive at his will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every ≈øin and noy≈øom lu≈øt. Oh therefore, all, come to the Light in each particular Con≈øcience, which is the pure gift of God; that by it you may ≈øee and di≈øcern the enemy of God, and of your ≈øouls deliverance out of that captivity, by which he would ≈øtill keep in bondage the ≈øoul, and the righteous Seed of the Lord God: but in the Light wait, and watch to ≈øee him in all his wiles and ways of working, to keep this Light in ob≈øcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the vertue of it under, that the glory of it might not be known. But, my dear friends, believing in the Light; and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øufficiency of it, Oh it will rai≈øe out of all ob≈øcurity, and it will ≈øhine, and di≈øcover all the darkne≈øs, and all the ways and works thereof; and it will ari≈øe in ≈øtrength, and whet its glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sword of power, to cut down all that ≈øtands in the way of it; and he will be known to be as a fire, to burn up all tho≈øe briars and thorns, cha≈øfe and ≈øtubble; for the Light of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> is as a fire, and his Holy One as a flame, to burn and con≈øume all that ≈øtand in the way of it, and nothing is to ≈øtrong for it; and though the ≈øins and iniquities, be as pricking briars and thorns, as cha≈øfe and ≈øtubble, and all gathered as thick combu≈øtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wound, prick, choke and ≈ømother, to darken, cloud, vail and cover this noble Seed and Off-≈øpring of Light, by its own power it will ari≈øe out of it all, and make it all manife≈øt to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54319:4"/>utter de≈øtruction, as there is a waiting in it; and ≈øo that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being felt and believed in, the further manife≈øtation of it will ari≈øe; and ≈øo it will be known, not onely to di≈øcover the darkne≈øs and deeds thereof, and the oppo≈øition the Prince of darkne≈øs makes again≈øt the Light, but ≈øet up his judging and condemning power, and his full ≈øtrength to cut off and de≈øtroy the Devil, and all that ≈øtands in the way of his ≈øetting up of his Kingdom of Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Peace in the hearts of men: And therefore doth he appear to ≈øit as a refiner of ≈øilver, and as with fullers ≈øope, to purifie and clean≈øe the hearts and con≈øciences of all tho≈øe that believe in him, who is the Light of the world; which in the fallen ≈øtate, and the unbelieving ≈øtate, are defiled by ≈øin and rebellion again≈øt the Lord: in which ≈øtate all men are in, let their Profe≈ø≈øion be what it will, till they come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light, the Seed of the everla≈øting Covenant, freely given unto man, for him to be guided by it alone; which who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to believe in, they receive the power and vertue of it, and ≈øo are acquainted with its operation, and the noblene≈øs of its ≈øtrength, life, dominion and authority; which gives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the power of darkne≈øs: but this glorious victory of the Lamb's power, who is the Covenant of Light, Truth, and Seed which ≈øerves the Lord, none can under≈øtand nor witne≈øs, while they ≈øtand in the di≈øobedience to the Light, which ≈øhines in the darkne≈øs, which comprehends it not. Therefore, if men would under≈øtand the manife≈øtation of this noble Seed, which is the glory of the whole Creation of God; for from that holy Womb where it re≈øts, and from whence it came, was the pure Creation brought forth, which was before corruption was; and therefore all the whole Creation mu≈øt be ≈øubject unto it, and its pure power, and mu≈øt believe in the lea≈øt appearance of it now, in its re≈øtauration of all things, as they were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Therefore there is an ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of believing in the mea≈øure of Light, manife≈øted from God in the heart and con≈øcience: though they be dark and covered with the ≈øhadow of death, this Light doth ≈øhine upon them that ≈øit in darkne≈øs, and in the ≈øhadow of death: And it is for this end, that they upon, and in whom it ≈øhines, may turn to the Light, that by it they may be turned from the darkne≈øs and death, and ≈øo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54319:5"/>might not abide in death and darkne≈øs, but might receive the light of Life, and ≈øo come to be acquainted with its power and vertue; that in the Light and Life, they may walk, abide, and dwell; and ≈øo no more to be of the night of thick darkne≈øs, but of the pure ≈øun-≈øhine of the clear day; by which they come to be known to be the children of the day, redeemed by him who is Light; unto him <hi>all power is given both in heaven and in earth,</hi> to redeem from the dark ≈øtate, which the whole world lie in; that do not, nor will not believe in the Light of Chri≈øt in their hearts, freely given from the Father of Lights, which is their condemnation, which in its day and time hath ≈øhined upon them; but they ≈øtill rejecting of it, this Light comes to be put out, as to them, though never can be, as in it ≈øelf, but it ≈øhines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bright and clear; and to ≈øuch in whom it is put out, it will be known, to be <hi>a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> who is <hi>a con≈øuming fire,</hi> and <hi>everla≈øting burnings,</hi> to all that wilfully di≈øobey, and reject the Light which ≈øhined in them; which is a manife≈øtation of the glorious Go≈øpel of the ble≈ø≈øed God, who≈øe ≈øound is gone forth over all the earth, and his word unto the end of the world: And if this Go≈øpel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo≈øt; and ≈øuch are they that hate the Light, and will not believe in it: And the god of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of them that reject and ≈ølight ≈øo great Salvation, as this is which hath been ≈øo freely preached, and declared of, and witne≈ø≈øed unto, by many of the dear Servants and Children of the living God, in this our day and age in which we live. Oh that men therefore, before this day be pa≈øt, would con≈øider and return to the mea≈øure of Light in them, before it be put out, and believe in it; and then they ≈øhall know that it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but ≈øpiritual, and of a ≈øpiritual nature, property, and quality, and of the nature of God, who is Light; of which, all that believe in it, are made partakers of his divine Nature: and it is able to teach them all things, that pertain to Life and godline≈øs; and to reveal the great my≈øtery of godline≈øs, <hi>God manife≈øt in fle≈øh;</hi> and the glory of God in the face of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: And that is the fir≈øt Principle of the Oracle of God, which leadeth unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works, to ≈øerve the living and true God, that made Heaven and Earth the Sea and all things therein: and ≈øo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54319:5"/>come to know the Word by which al things were made, by which we live, move, and have our being, even by him who is Light, which is the beginning of the Creation of God, both old and new: And ≈øo his power comes to be witne≈ø≈øed, and magnified over all, and his glory doth ari≈øe over all the works of his hands; the noble and royal Seed, and off-≈øpring of the infinite God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witne≈ø≈øed to be rai≈øed up by his power, and that glorifies him from whence it comes; and ≈øo coming to know this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of Light, which is the free gift of God in man, and minding of it, it will bring to wait in the ≈øilence, to know his voice, which calls to be cool, calm, quiet and ≈øtill: for it ≈øtills the raging waves of tho≈øe tumulting thoughts, and imaginations, and con≈øultings of the carnal rea≈øoning, of that part which ≈øtands in the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and would have audience, ≈øo as to prevail over the charming of the wi≈øe charmer: Now the Light gives the knowledge of that part, and the ground from whence it ≈øprings, the nature of the corrupt tree, and plant which God never planted, and ≈øeed which he never ≈øowed, but is of the Devil the cunning Serpent; and this is needful for every one to know the nature of the≈øe two ≈øeeds; be you wi≈øe or fooli≈øh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wi≈ødom of this world, which mu≈øt be brought to nought; be you poor or rich, bond or free, male or female. Now the way to come to a perfect knowledge of the two Seeds, which are one contrary to the other, as light is to darkne≈øs, and death to life, and good to evil; you mu≈øt know that in your ≈øelves which is as a weight and burthen upon your hearts and minds; and you minding of it, you will know it to be God's call and knock in man, that he may be heard, and his voice known, that ≈øo his coun≈øel may be under≈øtood, and the operation of his hand may be felt, and his divine power re≈øerved to work out all that which is contrary to him; and that wrought and e≈øtabli≈øhed in them, which is of him≈øelf, that he may be known to dwell and abide, and walk in them by his Seed, that thereby they may do his will, and be ≈øubject to his power, that ≈øo his power may be magnified over all. Now the cau≈øe why the way, word and voice, of the Lord God is not known, nor the workings of his divine power witne≈ø≈øed in men, is, becau≈øe they mind not to turn into that which ≈øecretly knocks and calls at the door of their hearts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54319:6"/>but turn a≈øide from it, though many times the weight may be ≈øo heavy upon them, that they know not how to bear it; and the rea≈øon of that is, the loving of their evil deeds, and their hating and ≈ølighting of the Light which doth reprove them; and ≈øo, as much as in them lies, run away from that which would do them good, into the evil, as into jollity and ≈øome outward vain thing; or into the multitude of outward affaires of the world; that ≈øo by the rea≈øon of the noi≈øe of that, they may not hear the ≈øound of the pure voice of the Lord God in the wilderne≈øs, that would make ≈øtreight the way of the Lord, for his ran≈øomed to pa≈øs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to come out of <hi>Egypt's</hi> Land of darkne≈øs, to walk in the light of the living, on which their eternal welfare depends, both here, and for ever hereafter: And the rejecting, and not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knock, voice, and call of the Light of the Son of God, which ≈øtands at the door of their hearts, and knocks, that he might have entrance in, and be received by them into their hearts; I ≈øay, the rejecting of his knock, drowns many in perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is the cau≈øe why they wallow in their blood, even in their ≈øin and iniquity, and become enemies to God, and his pure way in which all his dear ≈øervants walk in; which is the Light of the Lord God, and by it they know his knocks and calls, checks and reproofs, condemnation, ≈øalvation, and ju≈øtification unto life. O that men would hear, fear, dread and repent, and not ≈ølight ≈øo great ≈øalvation, &amp; not trample under foot the blood of the everla≈øting Covenant of Light and Life, nor count it as an unholy thing; but that they would turn to the calls, and knocks of the Lord God; and that they would under≈øtand what he ≈øaith, <hi>Behold, I ≈øtand at the door and knock;</hi> and every one that hears, and obeys, and receives him in, he doth come and ≈øup with them, and they come to be made partakers of his banquets, and of the wine and milk that he hath mingled, and prepared for them, in his own hou≈øe: which hou≈øe of God, none can know, nor the Laws, nor Ordinances thereof, that knows not his voice, knock, and call; and that doth reject it, and will not obey it; when they come but in the lea≈øt mea≈øure to know it; as ≈øome may know it by its often following of them, with Plagues and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their di≈øobedience; and to bring them into obedience to the mea≈øure of Light made manife≈øt in their Con≈øciences;

But, <hi>Oh God! thy Throne endures for ever, and the ≈øcepter of thy Kingdom is an everla≈øting Scepter of</hi> living <hi>righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs;</hi> And thy foundation is from everla≈øting; and this foundation Stone thou ha≈øt laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> thy beloved Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that which is built thereupon, is of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath its being and ≈øtanding in that which was before the foundation of the Earth was laid; the unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable power of the Lord God, which was before any thing was, unto which the changable, vi≈øible, di≈ø≈øolvable, moveable power mu≈øt be ≈øubject: Yea, thy own whole Creation, which thou made≈øt, which is good, as thou made≈øt it, and man in it upright; and thou made≈øt it all to be ≈øubject to thee, and to ≈øtand in thy coun≈øel, and to ≈øubject to thy holy will; but the ≈øubtil Serpent wrought
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54319:10"/>in ≈øubtilty, to betray the innocent being, which God had made, he being ignorant of that foundation which was in the very ≈øecrets of God's heart, and which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in his own ≈øecret coun≈øel, for man's re≈øtauration back again into a more ≈øure ≈øtanding, than upon any righteou≈øne≈øs of man's own; and that man might be built upon the foundation that ≈øtandeth ≈øure, and that upon it might ≈øtand firm; never to be removed from it by all the ≈øubtilty and ≈øleights of the enemy, nor by none of all the ≈øtorms, and tempe≈øt, and violent floods, and waves of foming Seas that he may rai≈øe, and may be very ready to go over the Souls: But the Decree being ≈øet, <hi>Hither mu≈øt thou go, and no further; here mu≈øt thy proud waves be ≈øtayed:</hi> And therefore now being come to that, which was hid in God before the world was; the great my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God revealed in us, which is Chri≈øt, the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, in whom we were cho≈øen before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was laid, and we are come to that which ≈øhall abide for ever; when all things are di≈ø≈øolved, which have done their work, that was to la≈øt the time appointed: And when all tho≈øe ≈øpirits that would draw &amp; rend from this ≈øure foundation, Chri≈øt, the light &amp; everla≈øting rock; tho≈øe ≈øpirits ≈øhall weary them≈øelves for very vanity, and ≈øhall eat the fruit of their own wayes, which will be indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath; and ≈øhall be ≈øerapated from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the God of our Life, and we in him ≈øhall have the victory in the Lamb's power, and authority over all the ≈øubtil temptations of the wicked one; and we ≈øhall ≈øit in the habitation of Peace and Re≈øt, above all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of Cruelty, and over all deceitful workings of guileful Men, in the Dominion that our Captain hath purcha≈øed for us, which an≈øwereth the will of his Father,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54319:11"/>which gave him a ran≈øom for many; that our A≈ø≈øurance may ≈øtand, as it doth upon a more ≈øure Foundation, and better Promi≈øes, than that of the Law of Works; that ≈øo we might not be ≈øhaken, nor moved in our minds, nor hearts, by any ≈ølights of the Devil, nor Men, which lye in wait to deceive; They being ignorant of God's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, and of his great love towards us that believe, and hope in his mercy for ever: And in that love, life, and power of his everla≈øting righteou≈øne≈øs, we can ≈øee through all the thick darkne≈øs of this world; and over all the confu≈øed commotions, and ≈øtirs of the many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are <hi>People, Nations, and Languages of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the <hi>My≈øtery of Iniquity:</hi> And that which doth ≈øee through all the≈øe, is the immortal Seed, the power of the infinite God, the Light and Spirit of Truth, which gives the victory over them all: Therefore know it more and more, that ≈øo in it you may ≈øtand, and be bold, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, you ≈øpiritual Warriors of, and in the Lamb's power; and that meddle not with the lower powers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of this world, which lie in wickedne≈øs, and ≈øo act with carnal weapons, the will of the Devil, which acts in wicked men, their wicked ends to accompli≈øh; in which ≈øtands their ≈øtrength and outward force, of the weapons of war which are carnal; but our weapons are ≈øpiritual and not carnal, which do over come the ≈øtronge≈øt force of all outward ≈øtrength of Men and Devils: For they war with the arm of fle≈øh, again≈øt Chri≈øt the great power of God; we ≈øtanding fa≈øt in the Truth, ≈øhall ≈øee the Spirit of the Lord will bla≈øt them all, with his Spirit of patience and long-≈øuffering; which is the Lambs power, which gives the Faith and Victory over all, through the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chri≈øt, which is, as I ≈øaid, the great power, wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54319:11"/>and righteou≈øne≈øs of God the Father of all things, who is ordained a Light and a Lamp for ever, to light the <hi>I≈ørael</hi> of God, into that ≈øtate, where there will be no need of the Sun nor Moon, for the Lord God and the Lamb will be their Light for ever and evermore, Amen.</p>
